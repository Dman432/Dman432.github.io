  </header>

  <div class="main">

    <p> My life so far has been pretty good... I am currently going to JHS learning coding and computer repair, I am also taking a class on marketing.
      I have taken a welding class along with a small gass engines class because I wish or seek to become a welder, even though it may be a robotics welder. I will during my second semester
      be taking advanced welding, I currently am unemployed but working hard to get a job. I have many freinds who are really great people and like to have fun just like everyone else.
      I live in jerome Idaho a quit place really even though recently there have been alot of people moving to Jerome or Idaho in general. I am still trying to get straight A's so that my
      grade point average goes up, and that is pretty much it, beides the fact that I am currently the vice president of gaming club.</p>

        and never complains about a thing besides when the kids are lazy, including me, and don't or wont get their chore done. my father is also a hard worker although he really loves

        <h1>About my father</h1>
        <p>My father was a tanker in the military, he drove the tank and helped reload the guns. he is an experienced worker that works really hard and I think it really stresses him out and
          thats why he has white hair even though he is still pretty young like only in his 40s. My father has traveled around the world with my grandmother and grandfather, he is still and
          has always been a very skilled gamer. he likes too play role playing games like DND and DC omline, he has a very sweet sweet tooth that leads him to stealimg cookie dough while my
          is trying to bake cookies... and when she catches him it is really funny!</p>

          <h1>About my mother</h1>
          <p>My mother was born in Idaho and has never lived anywhere else since, she used to go to burley high school. she was and still is the best mathmatition in the family, she loves
            loves to cook for people , and her favorit food is a healthy salad. she used to play sports like baseball till she had an injury that still affects her today she is a really
            strong person who never gives up and always finds a solution. she loves to play around with words and make jokes and tease my father a lot, she is also a very good reader and she
            is also very good at burning people with words of steel. No really she is like really good at it! she loves fantasy books and movies just like me, she also believes in the spirits
            among other things.</p>

            <h1>About my brother</h1>
            <p>My brother is two years younger than me and really is a very smart person. Even though he rather not show it, he passes all of his classes and still acts like a retard.
              really enjoys video games and sometimes can't stop playing them. he loves pizza and candy, plus he enjoys beeting people with word play, name calling, burns, etc., he hates
              reading and drawing and writing. he also thinks that school is pointless and unecessary, along with the fact the they arn't a lot of fun to be in. I think that he wants to be
              a game designer and design games that are pretty much pointless to play.</p>

              <h1>About my sister</h1>

                if you can get her to work! she doesn't like manual labor and enjoys swimming unless the water is cold.she loves fruits and vegitables along with minecraft and youtube. she hates reading
                and hates sitting still.</p>

                <p>He is a lobrador and is a black dog who even though it really tires him out likes running until he can't no more no matter the weather. he loves to play fetch and hates cats
                  but loves to chase them no matter what. he doesn't listen to me very well but he will listen to My mom because he's a momas boy.</p>

                  <h1>About my other dog "Sandy"</h1>
                  <p>Sandy is completly different than Bearamuss. For one she is calm and mellow and really loves my dad, Two she enjoys laying in the middle of the path even though she runs
                    the risk of being stepped on which is a little anoying. third she sheds a lot she could literally lie down and get up one minutelater and thered be a huge clump of hair in her place
                    this although funny is anoying to clean up. she is also a labrador but she is white unlick bear. together they are the yin and yan.</p>
