  <h2>About MTG</h2>
    <p> MTG or Magic the Gathering is a card game that involves mythical creatures and as predicted Magic.
Mtg was first created by Richard garfield in 1993, and published by Wizards of the Coast and is Still played today.
MTG has five main colors that pretty much define it, red, white ,blue, black, and green.
These are the five colors and they can be mixed into combinations or multicolored decks.
If your worrying about decks don't I explain later.

  <h2>A little more to know</h2>
  <p>MTG IS a game that I enjoy playing a lot because there are multiple ways to win the game.
There's milling which is when you make the person discard their deck into the graveyard,
Or there is a way to win by life were you gain or have more life than everyone, etc.

 <div id="Rules =(">
  <h2>Some of the Rules<h2>
  <p> There are some rules that everyone should know.
	<ol>
<li>You shuffle then draw seven cards no more no less.</li>
<li>You get to draw one card every turn unless you are the one to go first</li>.
<li>Each turn your are allowed to play one land
,is called mana and basically is what you need to cast spells</li>
</ol>
And those are the three basic rules that every player knows there is a lot more you can do though.

Like you can create and use combos to defeat your enemies and their monsters.
You can hit hard and fast against your opponent and destroy their HP.

<div id="Why you should play Mtg">
  <h2>Why you should play Mtg</h2>
     <p>You should play Mtg because it is a fun game that makes you think and strategize and,  well basically make your brain work.
I might be a little biased but Mtg is a lot of fun you get to play in tournaments, with other friends or family, and it's a lot of fun when you win in this game.
I ask that you at least try it at your local card store and see if you like if you don't you can just sell the cards you bought to someone else and forget about it and never play again.</p>
