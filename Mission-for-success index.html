  <div class="plan">

    <p> The Plan is to graduate high school and get my high school diploma, then I will go to college to learn more about robotics. During that time I will work to get a job as a welder
      or another job as long as I can get some money saved so that I don't end up in to much dept when I go to college. after college I will try to get a welding job (if I havn't already). I plan to live in jerome unless deemed
      impossible or unneccessary. I want to go to college for robotics because robotics is starting to sky rocket and there will be robotic welders, so if i know how to
      work the robot or fix then I can keep my Job a little longer.</p>

      <h1 class="h1"> More details</h1>
      <p> I plan to get a job as soon as drivers ed is over, and start saving money for college. I know that the sooner I get on this the Better so I will
        work hard to make this happen. Just so I am sure I have a Little extra cash I will take a year before going to a college of my choice, and from there on I will
        apply for multiple jobs. I heard that the High school in jerome allows you to get your welders permit, so part of the plan is to try and get it there and then get
        apply for a welding job. If I get one then I will work hard to keep the job. When I go to college I will go to learn robotics welding or just robotics. I will do This
        because I truly believe that robotics are going to take over lots of jobs in america. after college I will work hard and live my life and when I am too old to work
        in a workshop I will transfer to desk job or somewhere else maybe some were were I can teach students about welding.</p>

        <h1> Reason for wanting to weld</h1>
        <p> the reason I wish to weld is as simple as writing as a peice of paper. I wish to weld because It amazes me and excites me knowing that humanity alone has
          evolved so far, that we can now build skyscrapers with a lot of metal and a few blowtorches. it amazes me that most of Humanities inventions use welding to make them
          better. All in all I am in love with the fact that what humans used to think was inpenatrable, Immune to everything, and strongest material on earth can be melted
          and combined with more metal to make it stronger and better that it used to be.
